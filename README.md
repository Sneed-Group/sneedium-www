## Testing, compiling, and creation notes

To clone and run this repository you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```

Keep in mind you also need a copy of the WINE project and need to be on Linux.

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
- `preload.js` - A content script that runs before the renderer process loads.

## What is Privacy Redirection Technology (PRT)?

This is a simple technology that replaces a bad URL with a more privacy friendly service, when we know that ADs aren't 100% blocked, or just to provide a better UX. TLDR: Clickjacking for the greater good.
